					<div><p class="txtindent">YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY CHECKING THE BOX AND CLICKING THE "SUBMIT" BUTTON, OR BY USING THE DEMETER PLATFORM, YOU ARE AGREEING 
							TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE DEMETER PLATFORM.

					</div>

					<div><h4>1. THE DEMETER PLATFORM.</h4></div>
					<div><h5>1.1 Purpose of the Demeter Platform.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">The Demeter Platform allows Clients and Freelancers to identify each other and enable them to buy and sell Services online. Under this Agreement, 
						Demeter provides services to both Clients and Freelancers, including curating Clients and Freelancers, facilitating the formation of contracts 
						between Clients and Freelancers, and managing disputes related to those contracts. Clients post jobs and invite Freelancers to apply. Freelancers
						post profiles and bid on jobs. If a Client and Freelancer agree on terms, a Service Contract is formed directly between such Client and Freelancer
						subject to the provisions set forth in Section 3 (Service Contract Terms Between Client and Freelancer). Demeter pays Freelancers in connection with 
						their delivery of services through the Demeter platform. Demeter collects payment from Clients in connection with their receipt of services through the Demeter platform.</p>
					</div>
					<div><h5>1.2 Eligibility.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">The Demeter Platform is available only to legal entities and persons who are at least eighteen (18) years old and are otherwise capable of forming legally 
						binding contracts under applicable law. User agrees that User is not (a) a citizen or resident of a country in which use or participation is prohibited by 
						law, decree, regulation, treaty or administrative act; (b) a citizen or resident of, or located in, a country or region that is subject to U.S. or other 
						sovereign country sanctions or embargoes; or (c) an individual or an individual employed by or associated with an entity identified on the U.S. Department of 
						Commerce's Denied Persons or Entity List, the U.S. Department of Treasury's Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons Lists, or the Department of State's 
						Debarred Parties List or otherwise ineligible to receive items subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, or other economic sanction rules of any sovereign nation.</p></div>
					<div><h4>2. DEMETER GENERAL USER POLICIES</h4></div>
					<div><h5>2.1 Demeter Fees.</h5></div>
					<div><p  class="txtindent">Demeter charges Freelancers a fee for the services of connecting them with the Clients that hire them and collecting payment for work. Typically, 
						this fee is equal to 5% of Client's payments, plus a fee for disbursements. If Freelancer elects disbursement through a third party, the third 
						party may assess additional fees. If Freelancer elects disbursement in foreign currency, Demeter adds a conversion fee of 1.5% to the spot rate quoted by its foreign exchange vendor.</p></div>
					<div><h5>2.2 General User Obligations.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">You will not access (or attempt to access) the Site by any means other than the interface provided, and you will not use information from the Site for any purpose other
						than the purpose for which it was made available. You will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the functioning of the Site. You will not upload 
						or attach an invalid or malicious or unknown file. You will not insert any external links that may be malicious or unknown to you, or used for offering any goods or services other than Services.</p></div>
					<div><h5>2.3 Identity and Account Security.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">Demeter reserves the right to validate User information at any time, including but not limited to validation against third party databases or the verification
						of one or more official government or legal documents that confirm the User's identity. You authorize Demeter, directly or through third parties, to make any 
						inquiries necessary to validate your identity and confirm your ownership of your email address or financial accounts, subject to applicable law. 
						Failure to provide information about you and your business when requested is a violation of this Agreement. The User is solely responsible for ensuring 
						and maintaining the secrecy and security of the User's Demeter account password. User agrees not to disclose this password to anyone (or, in the case of an Agency (as defined below in Section 3),
						not to disclose this password to anyone who is not a subcontractor of such Agency), and shall be solely responsible under all circumstances for any use of or action taken through the use of such password 
						on the Demeter Platform. You must notify Demeter Support immediately if you suspect that your password has been lost or stolen. By using your Demeter User account, you acknowledge and agree 
						the Demeter's account security procedures are commercially reasonable.</p></div>
					<div><h5>2.4 Disbursements to Freelancers.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">Demeter will automatically disburse funds to Freelancers according to the payment instructions on file with Demeter no more than one month after funds become payable (or within six months, for amounts less than $100). 
						Funds become payable to Freelancers working on Hourly Contracts following the expiration of the dispute period and the security period associated with each work week. Funds become payable to Freelancers
						working on Fixed Price Contracts after Clients accept work submitted by a Freelancer. Clients retain the ability to change the terms of a Fixed Price Contract, including the amount of money owed on a 
						Fixed Price Contract, until they accept the work. Freelancers may ask Demeter to expedite payments. Demeter reserves the right to refuse any such request and may assess a processing fee in connection with such a request.</p></div>
					<div><h5>2.5 Disintermediation.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">Client shall make all payments relating to, or in any way connected with, a Service Contract (including, without limitation, bonuses) through the Demeter Platform. Any action that encourages or solicits complete or partial 
						payment outside of the Demeter Platform is a violation of this Agreement. Should a Client or Freelancer (including an Agency) be found in violation of this section of this Agreement, it will owe Demeter an amount with 
						respect to each Service Contract equal to the greater of a) $2,500; or b) the applicable fees had the payments been processed through the Demeter Platform, plus 18%.</p></div>
					<div><h5>2.6 Buyout.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">Notwithstanding the provisions set forth above, Users may agree to provide or receive Services outside of the Demeter Platform with Users identified through Demeter. If the 
						Services are rendered more than three (3) years after the Client identifies the Freelancer through Demeter, no Demeter Fees or buyout provisions apply. If Services are rendered 
						outside of Demeter less than three (3) years after the Client identifies the Freelancer through Demeter, payments for such Services will not be subject to the Demeter Fees, provided
						that the Client pays Demeter a "Buy-Out" amount in accordance with the procedure set forth below:</p></div>
					<div><p>i.	Prior to contracting outside of Demeter to receive Services from a User identified through the Demeter system, the Client will notify Demeter in writing of its intent to pay the Buy-Out fee in lieu of the Demeter Fees.</p></div>
					<div><p>ii.	The Client will provide a good faith estimate of the then anticipated amount to be paid to the Freelancer for such Services during the fifty-two week period immediately following the date of such notice.</p></div>
					<div><p>iii.	The Client will pay or authorize Demeter to deduct from its account the greatest of (i) fifteen percent (15%) of the good faith estimate described above; (ii) fifty-two (52) times the "Average Weekly Demeter Fees" (as defined below); 
							or (iii) five hundred dollars ($500). For purposes of the foregoing, the "Average Weekly Demeter Fees" means the average weekly amount of Demeter Fees that became due to Demeter based upon work performed for Client by the Freelancer over the four
							(4) weeks immediately preceding the buy-out notice described above, not counting any weeks in which no Demeter Fees became due.</p></div>
					<div><h5>2.7 Non-payment.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">If Client fails to pay amounts due under this Agreement, whether by cancelling Client's credit card, initiating an improper charge-back, or any other means, Client's Demeter 
						account will be suspended, no additional payments will be processed, and any work-in-progress will be stopped. Without limiting other available remedies, Client must reimburse 
						Demeter for amounts due upon demand, plus any applicable processing fees, charges or penalties, plus interest at the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum
						allowed by law, plus attorneys' fees and other costs of collection as allowed by law. In its discretion, Demeter may set-off amounts due against other amounts received from or held for
						Client, make appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies and law enforcement authorities, and cooperate with them in any resulting investigation or prosecution.</p></div>
					<div><h5>2.8 Hold on funds.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">In cases of fraud, abuse or violation of this Agreement, the Demeter Payment Guarantee shall be revoked and all monies due to the Freelancer may be held and/or reclaimed, not just those from the Contract(s) under investigation.
						For Hourly-Rate Contracts only, Clients may dispute hours during the dispute period following the close of a weekly invoice period. It is the Client's responsibility to review the Work Diary and Time Log of every Service Contract 
						on a weekly basis and to file any disputes on a timely basis. Once the dispute period has passed, the charges are accepted by the Client and can no longer be disputed and can only be refunded by the Freelancer. Disputes can only
						address the hours billed, not the quality of the work performed or deliverables. Demeter will promptly investigate the Time Log to determine, in its sole discretion, whether an adjustment is appropriate. Demeter's determination shall be final.</p></div>
					<div><h5>2.9 Dispute Resolution Policy.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">For Hourly-Rate Contracts only, Clients may dispute hours during the dispute period following the close of a weekly invoice period. It is the Client's responsibility to review the Work Diary and Time Log of every Service Contract on a 
						weekly basis and to file any disputes on a timely basis. Once the dispute period has passed, the charges are accepted by the Client and can no longer be disputed and can only be refunded by the Freelancer. Disputes can only address the hours
						billed, not the quality of the work performed or deliverables. Demeter will promptly investigate the Time Log to determine, in its sole discretion, whether an adjustment is appropriate. Demeter's determination shall be final.</p></div>
					<div><h5>2.10 Enforcement of Agreement and Policies.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">Demeter has the right, but not the obligation, to suspend or cancel your access to the Demeter has the right, but not the obligation, to suspend or cancel your access to the Demeter Platform if it believes that you have violated or acted 
						inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this Agreement or violated our rights or those of another party. Without limiting Demeter's other remedies, we may suspend or terminate your account, use self-help in connection with our rights
						to reclaim any available funds, and refuse to provide any further access to the Demeter Platform to you if (a) you breach any terms and conditions of this Agreement or other written policies and procedures posted on the Site; (b) we are 
						unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us; or (c) we believe that your actions may cause legal liability for you, our Users or for Demeter. Once suspended or terminated, you MAY NOT continue to use the Demeter 
						Platform under a different account or re-register under a new account. If you attempt to use the Demeter Platform under a different account, we reserve the right to reclaim available funds in that account and/or use an available payment
						method to pay for any amounts outstanding. In addition, violations of this Agreement may be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and may result in additional penalties and sanctions. When your User account is canceled, you may no
						longer have access to any parts of the Demeter Platform, including data, messages, files and other material you keep on Demeter.</p></div>				
					<div><h4>3. SERVICE CONTRACT TERMS BETWEEN CLIENT AND FREELANCER.</h4></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">Unless otherwise agreed to in a writing signed by both Client and Freelancer, the terms and conditions of the Service Contract are as set forth in Sections 3.1 through 3.12 below ("Standard Terms"). Client and Freelancer may not agree to 
						any other terms and conditions that affect the rights or responsibilities of Demeter .</p></div>
					<div><h5>3.1 Services.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">Freelancer shall perform Services in a professional and workmanlike manner and shall timely deliver any agreed-upon Work Product.</p></div>
					<div><h5>3.2 Agency.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">Work performed on Hourly-Rate Contracts under a Freelancer's profile must be performed by the Freelancer represented. If the Freelancer wishes to subcontract with third parties to perform Services on behalf of the Freelancer on Hourly-Rate 
						Contracts, the Freelancer must do so as a legally recognized entity with the ability to hire and/or contract (an "Agency"). Freelancer and Agency agree and acknowledge that Agency's employees or contract personnel are not employees of Demeter or Client.
						Agency is solely responsible for all wages, costs, unemployment insurance, compensation insurance, and expenses of Agency's employees or contract personnel and has the sole and exclusive right to supervise and control them. Agency acknowledges and agrees
						that neither it, nor any of its employees or agents, shall have any claim under this Agreement for overtime pay, sick leave, holiday or vacation pay, retirement benefits, worker's compensation benefits, unemployment benefits, or any other employee benefits of any kind from Demeter or Client.</p></div>
					<div><h5>3.3 Client Payments and Billing.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">Client shall pay the agreed-upon amount for time spent (under Hourly-Rate Contracts) or the approved project (under Fixed-Price Contracts) to Demeter, and Client will have no obligation of payment to Freelancer. Freelancer agrees that it will be
						paid solely by Demeter and Freelancer will not have any recourse against Client if Freelancer is not paid by Demeter. For Hourly-Rate Contracts, Client is billed for hourly Freelancer Fees on a weekly basis. For payments under Fixed-Price Contracts, Client is billed immediately.</p></div>
					<div><h5>3.4 Termination of a Service Contract.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">Under Hourly-Rate Contracts, either party may terminate the Service Contract at any time for any or no reason. However, the Client remains obligated to pay for any time the Freelancer worked prior to termination.
						For Fixed-Price Contracts, the Client may terminate at any time but may not recover any payments already made. The Freelancer may terminate a Fixed-Price Contract at any time if no payment has been made. If a payment has been made on 
						a Fixed Price Contract, the Freelancer may terminate only with the Client's consent or after the payment has been refunded.</p></div>
					<div><h5>3.5 Client Deliverables.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">Client grants Freelancer a limited, non-exclusive, revocable (at any time, at Client's sole discretion) right to use the Client Deliverables as necessary for the performance of the Services. Client reserves all other rights and interest, 
						including, without limitation, all Proprietary Rights, in and to the Client Deliverables. Upon completion or termination of the Service Contract, or upon written request by the Client, Freelancer shall immediately return all Client Deliverables
						to the Client and further agrees to purge all copies of Client Deliverables and Work Product contained in or on Freelancer's premises, systems, or any other equipment otherwise under Freelancer's control. Within ten (10) days of Client's request,
						Freelancer agrees to provide written certification to the Client that all Client Deliverables have been returned or purged.</p></div>
					<div><h5>3.6 Work Product.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">Proprietary Rights in Work Product shall be owned by Freelancer until payment has been made by Client, at which time Freelancer will be deemed to have assigned all Proprietary Rights in the Work Product to Client. For Hourly-Rate Contracts, 
						Client must pay for all hours that qualify for the Payment Guarantee. For Fixed-Price Contracts, Client has complete and sole discretion whether and how much to pay; however, if Client does not pay in full, Freelancer may terminate the Service
						Contract by refunding any partial payment, and Freelancer will retain Proprietary Rights in Work Product. To the extent that under applicable law, Proprietary Rights cannot be assigned, Freelancer hereby irrevocably agrees to grant, and hereby grants,
						to Client an exclusive (excluding also Freelancer), perpetual, irrevocable, unlimited, worldwide, fully paid, and unconditional license to use and commercialize Work Product in any manner now known or in the future discovered. To the extent such license
						grant is not fully valid, effective or enforceable under applicable law, Freelancer hereby irrevocably agrees to grant, and hereby grants, to Client, such rights as Client reasonably requests in order to acquire, as close as possible, all rights equivalent
						to full legal ownership. In order to ensure that Client will be able to acquire, perfect and use such Proprietary Rights, Freelancer will: (i) transfer possession, ownership, and title to media, models, and other tangible objects containing Work Product to
						Client, including delivery of a complete copy of the source code for any software, documented in sufficient detail to enable a reasonably skilled programmer to correct, integrate and modify it; (ii) sign any documents at Client's request to assist Client in the 
						documentation, perfection and enforcement of its rights; and (iii) provide Client with support and reasonable access to information for recording, perfecting, securing, defending, and enforcing such Proprietary Rights in any and all countries. In the case that under 
						applicable law, Freelancer retains any rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal and any other rights that may be known as or referred to as "moral rights" (collectively "Moral Rights") or other inalienable rights to Work Product or Confidential Information 
						under this Agreement, Freelancer irrevocably agrees to waive, and hereby waives, all such rights, or, to the extent Freelancer cannot waive such rights, Freelancer agrees not to exercise such rights, until Freelancer has provided prior written notice to Client and then only 
						in accordance with any reasonable instructions that Client issues in the interest of protecting its rights. Freelancer's obligations under this Section 3.6 will continue even after Freelancer deregisters from or ceases use of the Demeter Platform. Freelancer appoints Client as 
						Freelancer's attorney-in-fact to execute documents on Freelancer's behalf for the purposes set forth in this Section 3.6.</p></div>
					<div><h5>3.7 Pre-existing Intellectual Property in Work Product.</h5></div>
					<div><p class="txtindent">Freelancer shall ensure that no Work Product created or delivered by Freelancer includes any pre-existing software, technology or other intellectual property, whether such pre-existing intellectual property is owned by Freelancer or a third party including, without limitation,
						code written by proprietary software companies or developers in the open source community (collectively "Pre-existing IP") without obtaining the prior written consent of the Client to the inclusion of such Pre-existing IP in the Work Product. Freelancer acknowledges that, 
						without limiting any other remedies, Freelancer shall not be entitled to payment for, and shall refund to Client any payments previously made by Client to Freelancer for, any Services performed on a Service Contract if the Work Product contains any Pre-existing IP that was
						not approved in accordance with this Section 3.7.</p></div>
				<div><h5>3.8 Worker classification.</h5></div>
				<div><p class="txtindent">Client assumes all liability for proper classification of Freelancers as independent contractors or employees based on applicable legal guidelines. This Agreement does not create a partnership or agency relationship between Client and Freelancer. Freelancer does not have 
						authority to enter into written or oral - whether implied or express - contracts on behalf of Client. Freelancer acknowledges that Demeter does not, in any way, supervise, direct, or control Freelancer's work or Services performed in any manner. Demeter does not set Freelancer's
						work hours and location of work, nor is Demeter involved in determining if the compensation will be set at an hourly or fixed rate or in setting the particular rate for a service contract. Demeter will not provide Freelancer with training or any equipment, labor or materials needed
						for a particular Contract. Demeter will not deduct any amount for withholding, unemployment, Social Security, or other taxes as it would in the case of an employee. Client and Freelancer will be solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made 
						to any federal, state, or local tax authority, in any nation, with respect to Freelancer's performance of Services. For Contracts classified as independent contractor relationships, Client may not require an exclusive relationship between Client and Freelancer. A Freelancer classified 
						as independent contractor is free at all times to provide Services to persons or businesses other than Client, including any competitor of Client. For Contracts classified as employer-employee relationships, Client will manage the Service Contract through the payrolling program made available 
						on the Demeter Platform by a third-party payroll provider, where the Freelancer becomes an hourly employee of such third-party payroll provider and Freelancer and Client enter into appropriate additional agreements. Client and Freelancer agree to indemnify, hold harmless and defend Demeter from any 
						and all claims arising out of or related to their Service Contract, including but not limited to claims that Freelancer was misclassified as an independent contractor, any liabilities arising from a determination by a court, arbitrator, government agency or other body that Freelancer was misclassified 
						(including, but not limited to, taxes, penalties, interest and attorney's fees), any claim that Demeter was an employer or joint employer of Freelancer, as well as claims under any employment-related laws, such as those relating to employment termination, employment discrimination, harassment or retaliation,
						as well as any claims for overtime pay, sick leave, holiday or vacation pay, retirement benefits, worker's compensation benefits, unemployment benefits, or any other employee benefits.</p></div>
				<div><h5>3.9 Audit Rights</h5></div>
				<div><p class="txtindent">Client and Freelancer each shall (i) create and maintain records to document satisfaction of its obligations under this Agreement and any Service Contract, including without limitation its payment obligations and compliance with tax laws, and (ii) provide copies of such records to Demeter 
						upon request. Demeter, or Demeter's advisors or agents, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to routinely, but no more frequently than annually, audit Freelancer's operations and records to confirm compliance. Nothing in this provision should be construed as providing Demeter with the right
						or obligation to supervise or monitor the actual Services performed by Freelancer.</p></div>
				<div><h5>3.10 Third Party Beneficiary</h5></div>
				<div><p class="txtindent">Demeter is hereby named as a third party beneficiary of each Service Contract.</p></div>
				<div><h5>3.11 General.</h5></div>
				<div><p class="txtindent">Service Contracts shall be governed by Sections 6 (Confidential Information), 11 (General), and 12 (Definitions) of this Agreement, as applicable either directly or by way of analogy.</p></div>
				<div><h5>3.12 Entire Agreement.</h5></div>
				<div><p class="txtindent">The terms and conditions set forth in this Section 3 and any additional or different terms expressly agreed by Client and Freelancer shall constitute the entire agreement and understanding of Client and Freelancer with respect to each Service Contract and shall cancel and supersede any other prior
						or contemporaneous discussions, agreements, representations, warranties, and/or other communications between them.</p></div>
